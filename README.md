Orbisius bbPress Enhancer - http://club.orbisius.com/products/
=========================

This WordPress plugin adds missing or not yet implemented functionality to bbPress. 

* This adds author support for the forum posts i.e. you can change the author of a bbPress forum post.

* Makes sure that the checkbox Notify me of follow-up replies via email below each forum reply is checked View
    When you have the checkbox checked this reduces chance of the user forgetting to click it and therefore won't be notified for future replies.

* Make the user autologin after registering
    This makes it super easy for the users after they register to be autologged in. Compatible with S2Member plugin.
